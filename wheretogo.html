	<h1>Where To Go</h1>

	<p>Among many places worth a visit within easy reach: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		Hunstanton 
		Sealife Centre is one of three National Seal Sanctuaries responsible 
		for the rescue, rehabilitation and release of wild animals including seal 
		pups found washed up on the British coastline. It also houses otters and 
		penguins, and lots of fish!
		</li>
		<li>
		The Oasis Leisure Centre offers indoor and outdoor swimming pools, indoor bowls 
		(winter only), squash, gymnasium, tennis, table tennis and skateboarding.
		</li>
		<li>
		Norfolk Lavender, in the nearby village of Heacham, is a must for gardening fans and a 
		pleasant way to while away a few hours with a guided tour, a trip to the 
		gift shop, or a cup of tea in delightful surroundings. Admission is free.
		</li>
		<li>
		Historic King’s 
		Lynn has a wide variety of shops and places of interest.
		</li>
		<li>
		Holkham Hall is a 
		stately home with, directly opposite, one of Britain’s best beaches - 9 
		miles of unspoilt sand, part of an English Nature reserve. Ideal for 
		birdwatching, a quiet stroll or just having a picnic.
		</li>
		<li>
		Burnham Market is 
		a delightful market town with a wide selection of specialist shops.
		</li>
		<li>
		If you want to see seals in the wild, try a boat trip to Blakeney Point. You can 
		practically stroke them, and you’d swear they were posing for photographs!
		</li>
		<li>
		Snettisham Farm Park has a good assortment of animals, ideal for keeping kids of all ages amused.
		</li>
		<li>
		Wells-next-the-Sea combines a charming harbour town with coastal views and a 
		miniature railway. 
		</li>
		<li>
		The Royal Estate of Sandringham is only a short drive away. 
		</li>
		<li>
		Castle Rising 
		Castle, situated between Hunstanton and King’s Lynn, is one of the 
		most famous 12th Century castles in England. The stone keep, built in around 
		1140ad, is amongst the finest surviving examples of its kind anywhere in the 
		country. It plays host to events ranging from 
		Romeo and Juliet in the open air, to jousting and battle re-enactments.
		</li>
		<li>
		Birdwatchers are well catered for, with RSPB 
		reserves at Snettisham and Titchwell.
		</li>
